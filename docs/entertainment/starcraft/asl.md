# StarCraft

Did you ever play StarCraft back in the days? Did you know that StarCraft Brood War is still played competitively in South Korea?

The two main drivers behind casting the games in English are Artosis and Tasteless. You can find the latest ASL (Afreeca Star League) Season 20 on YouTube.

!!! warning "Spoiler Alert"

    Be prepared that the playlist shows the finals and the player names in the final first so it might spoil if you intend to watch from the Round of 24 :eyes:
