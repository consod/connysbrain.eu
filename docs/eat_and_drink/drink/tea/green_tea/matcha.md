# Matcha

# Brands
The current brand I am drinking is Moya matcha. This is mainly because of the limited matcha supply here in Åland Islands. 
I however enjoy the daily grade but haven't yet tried the ceremonial grade. I also bought a Matcha shaker, which is basically a double insulated glass container. It works well enough for mixing.
