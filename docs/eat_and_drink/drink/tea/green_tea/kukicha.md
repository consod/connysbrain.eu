# Moya Kukicha

Moya Kukicha is an organic Japanese green tea made primarily from the stems and twigs of the tea plant (Camellia sinensis), rather than solely from the leaves used in most green teas.

## Flavor Profile

It offers a mild, rounded taste with nutty, honey-like sweetness and subtle umami notes, lacking the grassiness or bitterness of sencha. The light yellow-green brew is smooth and approachable

## Low Caffeine & Benefits

Low in caffeine (since caffeine concentrates in leaves) but higher in L-theanine, it promotes relaxation and is ideal for evenings or caffeine-sensitive individuals. Popular in macrobiotic diets for its alkaline properties.

## Brewing Tips

- Dose: 2–3g per 200ml water.
- Temp: 70–80°C (avoid boiling to prevent bitterness).
- Style: Excellent as hot tea or cold brew (refrigerate 4–8 hours for ultra-smooth results).
