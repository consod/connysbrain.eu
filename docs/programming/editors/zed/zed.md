# Zed.dev Love your editor again

## What is Zed?

I have recently started using [The Zed Editor](https://zed.dev/). I really like it's minimal interface and so far everything I have tried works. It is still under heavy development with new updates pushed daily.

## Extensions

My current Zed setup includes the following extensions:

- Git Firefly for Git syntax highlighting
- Catppuccin Mocha Theme and Catppuccin Mocha Icons
